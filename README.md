Hi 👋 My name is Joe Buonocore
==============================
Software Engineer and Small Business Owner
------------------------------------------
I've been writing code for fun since the 9th grade (mostly PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS). Professionally, I freelanced for five years before founding Albright Labs in January 2020 which I operate today full time. We're a small team but we've handled projects for sole proprietorships and publicly traded companies alike. We're currently working on a SaaS product of our own which we hope will deliver a lot of time-saving to other businesses.
